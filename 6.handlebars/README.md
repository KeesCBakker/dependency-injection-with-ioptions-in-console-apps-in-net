# Handlebars.Net & JSON templates
I ❤️ Handlebars! So I was very very very happy to see that Handlebars was ported to .NET! 
It is a mega flexible templating engine as it can easily be extended. I'm working on a 
project where I need to parse objects via JSON templates to JSON strings. This blog will 
show how to instruct Handlebars to parse into JSON and add some nice error messages 
if your template fails.
